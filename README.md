# DeepLearning Homeworks
The repository contains homeworks from Deep Learning course at Unipd 2021/22.

### Homework 1 - From Perceptron to DNN
Implementation of the backpropagation algorithm for the perceptron and a two-layer network, with sigmoid and mean squared error.

Training for the handwritten digits dataset using softmax and cross entropy loss function.

### Homework 2 - Optimize and Train Deep Models

Text classification with Tensorflow and Keras on the AG News Subset, dealing with overfitting.

Regularization methods as L1-norm, L2-norm, early stopping. Tuning of hyperparameters using model selection and Grid Search.
